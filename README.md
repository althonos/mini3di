## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

`mini3di` is a pure-Python package to encode 3D structures of proteins into 
the 3di alphabet, using the trained weights from the `foldseek` VQ-VAE model.

This library only depends on NumPy and is available for all modern Python
versions (3.7+). 

### üìã Features


### üßä Vectorization


## üîß Installing

For now, the package can be installed from the GitHub repository with `pip`:
```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/althonos/mini3di
```

<!-- Install the `mini3di` package directly from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mini3di)
which hosts universal wheels that can be installed with `pip`:
```console
$ pip install mini3di
``` -->

<!-- Otherwise, `mini3di` is also available as a [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
package:
```console
$ conda install -c bioconda mini3di
``` -->

<!-- ## üìñ Documentation

A complete [API reference](https://mini3di.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html)
can be found in the [online documentation](https://mini3di.readthedocs.io/),
or directly from the command line using
[`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html):
```console
$ pydoc mini3di
``` -->

## üí° Example

`mini3di` provides a single `Encoder` class, which expects the 3D coordinates
of the **CŒ±**, **CŒ≤**, **N** and **C** atoms from each peptide residue. For 
residues without **CŒ≤** (Gly), simply write the coordinates as `math.nan`. 
Call the `encode_atoms` method to get a sequence of 3di states:
```python
from math import nan
import mini3di

encoder = mini3di.Encoder()
states = encoder.encode_atoms(
    ca=[[32.9, 51.9, 28.8], [35.0, 51.9, 26.6], ...],
    cb=[[ nan,  nan,  nan], [35.3, 53.3, 26.4], ...],
    n=[ [32.1, 51.2, 29.8], [35.3, 51.5, 28.1], ...],
    c=[ [34.4, 51.7, 29.1], [36.1, 51.1, 25.8], ...],
)
```

The states returned as output will be a NumPy array of state indices. To turn
it into a sequence, use the `build_sequence` method of the encoder:
```python
sequence = encoder.build_sequence(states)
print(sequence)
```

The encoder can work directly with Biopython objects, if Biopython is available.
A helper method `encode_chain` to extract the atom coordinates from
a [`Bio.PDB.Chain`](https://biopython.org/docs/latest/api/Bio.PDB.Chain.html) 
and encoding them directly. For instance, to encode all the chains from a 
[PDB file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format)):
```python
import pathlib

import mini3di
from Bio.PDB import PDBParser

encoder = mini3di.Encoder()
parser = PDBParser(QUIET=True)
struct = parser.get_structure("8crb", pathlib.Path("tests", "data", "8crb.pdb"))

for chain in struct.get_chains():
    states = encoder.encode_chain(chain)
    sequence = encoder.build_sequence(states)
    print(chain.get_id(), sequence)
```
